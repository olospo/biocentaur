# Biocentaur

This Biocentaur theme uses continuous deployment. Theme files committed are uploaded to the FTP server. Any changes made outside of the repo will be overwritten by this process.

## Development
The `development branch` is used for local development, where you don't want files to be deployed to either staging or live.

## Staging
The `staging branch` is used to deploy changes made to the staging site.

## Live
The `master branch` is used to deploy changes made to the live site.
